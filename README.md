# Stalwart's dotfiles

On NixOS, repo should be cloned to `/home/stalwart/.swt`,
because with home-manager i had to choose
between immutable config files and hardcoded paths.

Some of these config files are more than two decades old though,
and expect the repo to be deployed to `/home/stalwart/.dotswt`.
